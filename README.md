# WhatsApp-Chatbot-in-PHP

A WhatsApp chatbot can be created in PHP using the Twilio API for WhatsApp.

 Here's a high-level overview of the steps:  
 
1. Sign up for a Twilio account and obtain a Twilio number with WhatsApp support. 

2. Set up a PHP web server to receive incoming messages from Twilio and send messages back. 

3. Use the Twilio API to send a message to a user to initiate a chat session. When a user sends a message to the Twilio number, the message is forwarded to your PHP server. PHP can then parse the message and determine how to respond. 

4. Use the Twilio API to send a message back to the user in response to the received message.
